# Java
Computer Science classes 110 and 205 taught the basics of Java and Object - Oriented Program. In this repository, find assignments regarding inheritance, abstract classes and aggregation, and more.

In the aggregation folder find an example of 2 classes having an aggregation relationship. Assignment4.java is the test driver. 

The Assignment 4 class displays a menu of choices to a user and performs a chosen task, based off of user input. It will keep asking a user to
enter the next choice until the choice of 'Q' (Quit) is entered.

In the inheritance folder, find a video game example. Assignment5.java is the test driver file and uses class hierarchy to calculate battle statistics for 
players/heroes in an action role-playing game. The program allows you to enter heroes with their characteristics and calculate their combat power.

The object - oriented programming folder contains a short example of using a swicth statement to execute various commands. While short, the .java file uses while and for loops, if, else stataments and mathematical logic.

The JavaFX folder contains a lengthy example of implementing the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The folder contains numerous classes that are used to represent a university's course registration portal. Users are able to add and drop classes freely, as long as all text fields are filled. The example handles all errors and displays the usage of try and catch, as well as error handling and event handling. This project does require JDK 8 or higher to run.

In the Serialization and Algorithims folder, find an interactive project utilizing searching, sorting, the Comparator interface, file reading and writing using BufferReaders, and Serialization and Deserialization.

The recursion folder contains a file writing simple mathematical formulas recurisively using a series of if-else statements and base cases.

Linked Lists contains a series of files mimicking a playlist generator. In the file, use 'Assignment9.java' as the test driver file. In the code, users are able to add, remove, iterate through, search, and replace specified songs.
